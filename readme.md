# THSH_40301

This is the class website's second version.

The first version is on http://user3.jabry.com/thshcla40301

## The "DIVI" structures

This website is using Data Import and View Including structure.

This structure is refer to MVC structure.

Because the website is less connection to the database, I use the tree size to get the view, css and javascript.

So, as you see, the index.php just get what it wants, the data and the view can give him everything.

If somebody think it should be improved, please leave some issue on this repo.
